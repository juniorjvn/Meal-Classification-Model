    "## Project Description\n",
    "In this project, we are considering the Artificial Pancreas medical control system, specifically the Medtronic 670G system. The Medtronic system consists of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and the Guardian Sensor (12), which is used to collect blood glucose measurements every 5 minutes. The sensor is single-use and can be used continuously for 7 days after which it has to be replaced. The replacement procedures include a recalibration process that requires the user to obtain blood glucose measurements using a Contour NextLink 2.4 glucosemeter ®.\n",
    " \n",
    "1\n",
    "Note that this process also requires manual intervention. The Guardian Link Transmitter® powers the CGM sensor and sends the data to the MiniMed 670G® insulin pump. The insulin pump utilizes the Smart Guard Technology that modulates the insulin delivery based on the CGM data. The SmartGuard Technology uses a Proportional, Integrative, and Derivative controller to derive small bursts of insulin also called Micro bolus to be delivered to the user. During meals, the user uses a BolusWizard to compute the amount of food bolus required to maintain blood glucose levels. The user manually estimates the amount of carbohydrate intake and enters it into the Bolus Wizard.\n",
    "The Bolus Wizard is pre-configured with the correction factor, body weight, and average insulin sensitivity of the subject, and it calculates the bolus insulin to be delivered. The user can then program the MiniMed 670G infusion pump to deliver that amount. In addition to the bolus, the MiniMed 670G insulin pump can also provide a correction bolus. The correction bolus amount is provided only if the CGM reading is above a threshold (typically 120 mg/dL) and is a proportional amount with respect to the difference between the CGM reading and the threshold.\n",
    "The SmartGuard technology has two methods of suspending insulin delivery: a) Suspend on low, where the insulin delivery is stopped when the CGM reading is less than a certain threshold, or b) suspend on predicted low, where the insulin delivery is stopped when the CGM reading is predicted to be less than a certain threshold. Apart from these options, insulin delivery can also be suspended manually by the user or can be suspended when the insulin reservoir is running low."

    "## Extraction: Meal data\n",
    "1. From the InsulinData.csv, search column Y(BWZ Carb Input(grams)) for a non-NAN non-zero value. This time indicates the start of the meal consumption time tm.\n",
    "2. FromCGMData.csv,get the glucose time series data corresponding to themeal(tm).\n",
    "3. Mealdata comprises a 2hr30 min stretch of CGMData. So once you get the corresponding glucose time look for a 2hr stretch (tm+2hrs) which is the postprandial period. In addition, take a 30 min stretch (tm-30min) before the start of the meal (tm).\n",
    "4. To extract the meal data there can be three conditions:\n",
    "    - There is no meal from time tm to time tm+2hrs.Then use this stretch as meal data\n",
    "    - There is a meal at some time tp in between tp>tm and tp<tm+2hrs.Ignore the meal data at time tm and consider the meal at time tp instead. For example, suppose the start of the meal (tm) is at 9:15 and you find a meal at 10:00 (tp) where tp > tm and tp < tm+2hrs, consider the meal at tp.\n",
    "    - There is a meal at time tm+2hrs, then consider the stretch from tm+1hr 30min to tm+4hrs as meal data.\n",
    "5. Eachstretchwillbeonerowandwillhave30columnsi.e.2hr30minstretchforevery5 minutes in CGMData.csv. After extracting the all meal data, you need to create a Meal Data Matrix (P x 30) where P is the total number of rows for the meal data time series.\n"
